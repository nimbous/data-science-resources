# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Read [the awesome manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/master/awesome.md) and ensure your list complies.
- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure your list is useful before submitting. That implies it having enough content and every item a good succinct description.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Please use `sentence case` for titles. Sentence case, capitalises titles as if they were sentences. This means that only the first word in titles should be capitalised. One exception here is proper nouns, which are always capitalised.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Use the following format: `[Title](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- The pull request and commit should have a useful title.

Thank you for your suggestions!
